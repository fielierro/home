# Script by the late, great Jim Murray.  I love that Jim could do this in eight lines.
#
# The combine script takes list of files and combines them into a single file 
# called "combined".  After editing "combined" and executing it, any files that 
# changed in the combined copy are replaced with the updated version.
#
# For example, to replace the word PATTERN in a directory tree:
#
# combine $(find . -type f -exec grep -l -e  PATTERN {} + )
# sed -i "" "s/PATTERN/NEWPATTERN/g" combined
# bash ./combined
# 
(   for i in $*
    do
	echo "cat > xxx << \EoFoF$i"
	awk '{ print }' $i
	echo EoFoF$i
	echo "cmp -s xxx $i || (mv $i $i~;mv xxx $i;echo new version of $i)"
    done
) > combined
