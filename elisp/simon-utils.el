;;; Commentary:

;; This package contains a random collection of functions I've written
;; to automate some of the repetitive editing tasks when writing new
;; code. A side benefit is that they implicitly enforce our coding
;; conventions.

  "^[ \t]*#include[ \t]+[<\"]\\([a-zA-Z0-9_.]+\.h\\)[>\"][ \t]*$"
  "Regular expression used to detect #include directives")

(defconst bt-file-suffix-regexp
  "\\.\\([a-zA-Z0-9]+\\)$"
  "Regular expression used to detect and extract the suffix of a file name")

; FIXME: this should really get the comment character from the current
;        mode so that it can be used for other languages too.
